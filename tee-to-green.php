    <h3>The First Tee Nine Healthy Habits</h3>
    The First Tee Nine Healthy Habits were created to promote healthy, active lifestyles for young people. The healthy habits are a list of nine health and wellness topics presented as a part The First Tee, formatted for easy understanding and learning by elementary-age students and chapter participants.
  </div>

  <div style="clear: both;"></div>

  <h4>PHYSICAL</h4>
  <div class="one-third">
    <strong>Energy -</strong> It is important to understand and make healthy choices about when to eat, how much to  eat, and the types of food and drinks to provide the body with the most useful energy.
  </div>

  <div class="one-third">
    <strong>Play -</strong> A variety of energizing play can help the body stay strong, lean and fit, and be fun in the process. Sleep and other forms of "re-charging" allow one to engage in play on a daily basis.
  </div>

  <div class="one-third last">
    <strong>Safety -</strong> Physical safety includes playing in a safe environment and by the rules, protecting the body with proper equipment, warm-up and cool-down and wearing sun protection.
  </div>

  <div style="clear: both;"></div>
  <br>

  <h4>EMOTIONAL</h4>
  <div class="one-third">
    <strong>Vision -</strong> In order to make the most of one's unique gifts &mdash; talents, characteristics and abilities &mdash; an individual needs to learn from the past, value the present, create their vision and future to ultimately "leave a footprint."
  </div>

  <div class="one-third">
    <strong>Mind -</strong> The mind is a powerful tool for health. One's mind influences his/her emotions and behaviors and can be utilized for self-improvement, building confidence and maintaining perspective.
  </div>

  <div class="one-third last">
    <strong>Family -</strong> When family members participate in activities together &mdash; share meals, communicate and establish roles and responsibilities &mdash; they are more likely to be successful in achieving their health-related goals.Â 
  </div>

  <div style="clear: both;"></div>
  <br>

  <h4>SOCIAL</h4>
  <div class="one-third">
    <strong>Friends -</strong> Maintaining healthy relationships includes surrounding one's self with friends and supportive people, while effectively handling challenging situations, including bullying and navigating the digital age with social media.
  </div>

  <div class="one-third">
    <strong>School -</strong> Success in school &mdash; learning, building relationships and contributing to the school environment &mdash; leads to success in other areas of life.
  </div>

  <div class="one-third last">
    <strong>Community -</strong> Like the health of one's body, it is important to also explore the health of one's community and discover how one can give back and care for its environment and safety.

        The First Tee has established Nine Core Values that represent some of the many inherently positive values connected with the game of golf. By participating in The First Tee, young people are introduced to core values which are incorporated throughout the program. Parents are encouraged to reinforce these behaviors by talking about them, what they mean and what these behaviors can look like at home.
